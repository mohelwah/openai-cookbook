    "# Power your products with ChatGPT and your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a walkthrough taking readers through how to build starter Q&A and Chatbot applications using the ChatGPT API and their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is laid out in these sections:\n",
    "- **Setup:** \n",
    "    - Initiate variables and source the data\n",
    "- **Lay the foundations:**\n",
    "    - Set up the vector database to accept vectors and data\n",
    "    - Load the dataset, chunk the data up for embedding and store in the vector database\n",
    "- **Make it a product:**\n",
    "    - Add a retrieval step where users provide queries and we return the most relevant entries\n",
    "    - Summarise search results with GPT-3\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Q&A app in Streamlit\n",
    "- **Build your moat:**\n",
    "    - Create an Assistant class to manage context and interact with our bot\n",
    "    - Use the Chatbot to answer questions using semantic search context\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Chatbot app in Streamlit\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upon completion, you have the building blocks to create your own production chatbot or Q&A application using OpenAI APIs and a vector database.\n",

This system, which is based on   disciplinary and safety considerations, is part of the FIA International Sporting Code (herein referred to   as the ‘ISC’).      The objective of this system is to preserve and protect the FIA Formula One World Championship by   depriving, temporarily or definitively, any duly registered member of a Competitor's staff guilty of   conduct contrary to the FIA Code of Good Standing of the right to access the Reserved Areas at   events forming part of any FIA World Championship (see Article 30bis of the ISC).        I.     INTRODUCTION        These Practice Directions have been introduced by the FIA to clarify certain aspects of the new   system of certificate of registration for the staff of Competitors entered in the FIA Formula One World   Championship and the way in which the FIA intends to implement the system with regard to the FIA   Formula One World Championship.      However, these Practice Directions do not amend the ISC or the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules in   any way. Nor do these Practice Directions limit the discretion of the FIA International Tribunal (herein   referred to as ‘IT’) or the FIA International Court of Appeal (herein referred to as ‘ICA’).      These Practice Directions will be made available on the FIA website and that in relation to, and at the   time of, any determination being made by the IT or the ICA the FIA will submit a copy of these Practice   Directions to the applicable FIA court.
